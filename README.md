# Movie Fight
Movie Fight is a simple Javascript application where a user can search and select any two movies to compare their stats.
This project was done as part of this Udemy course - [The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial). Although it
should be noted that this is not a direct duplication of the code. I have added lots of personal changes in the overall code structure and the actual code. I think these changes
improve upon the original.

This app uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) and [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/). The [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/) api is used to search for and access movie data. You will
need your own api key to run this app. To get your own api key go to the OMDB site and follow their instructions.
